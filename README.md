# Portfolio
Full Stack Flex Bootcamp: Weekly Assignment #2


# Goal/Purpose

This project is my first attempt at creating a responsive 3 page website utilising Twitter bootstrap assets as well as implementing basic HTML and CSS learned over the last 2 weeks.

Functions learned/implemented:
* Bootstrap 4.5 assets:
    - learning how to use the Bootstrap grid system using containers, rows, sub-rows    and columns
    - Navigation Bar with Toggle Bar
    - Cards (inputting images, text) 
    - Basic Bootstrap forms (and grids eg. First Name & Last name input)

* Linking between multiple HTML pages via text links and Images (Portfolio thumbnails are links but do not go anywhere)

* Practice of HTML/CSS styling using margins & padding

* Utilising a reset.css file to provide a standardised css for all browsers before implementing intended website design 

* Implementation of media queries within CSS to create a responsive website that changes website styling based on screen size

* Use of Google Fonts



# Issues/Notable Points

* Toggle button was not triggering the dropdown bar to show the clickable options in the the navbar - This required additional links to Javascript and jQuery files within the HTML

* It took some time to figure out how to align each of the thumbnails into the uniform grid as displayed in a desktop - including class 'mr-auto' aligned each of the thumbnails in the correct position

* Each row of thumbnails did not have a 'gutter' to space them out - this was solved by adding 'mb-5' to each row to edit the margin below each row

* instructions for this assignment is that content is to fill the whole screen once the screen is smaller and meets the px requirements for the media query however due to time constraints and difficulty finding the solutions this was not propertly implemented

* Due to specificity of the bootstrap elements, it proved difficult to style some of the elements used in the website (eg. the Navbar) - after many attempts, for simplicity purposes and to avoid breaking functionality of elements - default styling of Navbar was used.
